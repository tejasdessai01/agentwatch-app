# ClawSight 🦅 — Mission Control for Autonomous Agents

**Open-source dashboard for real-time agent observability.** See every thought, token, and dollar your bots burn — kill loops instantly, share read-only sessions, and keep multiple tenants safe.

## Why ClawSight?
| Problem | ClawSight Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Agents run headless in the cloud — you have zero visibility. | Live-stream every log/status update to a web UI. |
| API/token bills spike before you notice. | Real-time cost + token tracking per agent and globally. |
| Rogue loops require SSH + guesswork. | One-click **KILL** button with confirmation + audit log. |
| Sharing/debugging is painful. | Generate read-only “👀 Share Links” for teammates/customers. |
| Multi-tenant SaaS needs isolation. | Supabase auth + scoped API keys + tenant-aware sockets. |

## Feature Highlights
- **Supabase Magic Link auth** → `/keys` onboarding with per-user `ck_live_…` keys.
- **Multi-tenant sockets** with hashed API keys + rate limits.
- **Demo tenant** auto-seeded so new users see value immediately.
- **Cost / token analytics** across agents + global P&L.
- **Kill + Share controls** on every card.
- **Deploy anywhere** (Render button, Docker, self-host).

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1) Install SDK (publish coming — see below)
npm install clawsight

# 2) Import + connect
const clawsight = require('clawsight');
const watcher = clawsight({
  server: 'https://app.clawsight.org',
  token: 'ck_live_...',
  id: 'trader-bot-01',
  name: 'Trader Bot'
});
watcher.log('Starting trade loop', 'working');
watcher.metric('cost', 0.02);
```

### First-run onboarding
1. Visit **https://app.clawsight.org/login.html** → enter email → click magic link.
2. `/keys.html` opens automatically → **Create Key** → copy `ck_live_…` value.
3. Paste key into dashboard modal + your agents.
4. If you have no agents yet, the **Demo Revenue Bot** appears so you can explore immediately.

## Publish checklist (owner action)
We renamed everything to `clawsight`, but the npm package isn’t live yet. To publish:
```bash
cd agentwatch-app/sdk
npm version 1.0.0
npm publish --access public
```
After that, update this README badge + examples if version changes.
